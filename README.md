# JaPomoC
Just another PokÃ©mon Clone

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kruecke/japomoc.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Kruecke/japomoc)

## Installation
This guide describes how to install JaPomoC on Ubuntu/Debian or Windows. If you are using an operating system other than these, have a look at [Running Cmake](http://www.cmake.org/runningcmake/) and [Compiling SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/) to get an idea on how to build this software.

If you are used to build software from sources, you might just take a brief look at [.travis.yml](https://github.com/Kruecke/japomoc/blob/master/.travis.yml) to get a quick overview on how to build this project.

### Installing on Linux
On Debian-like systems, you can get Git and your basic building tools by installing the following packages.
```
# apt install git cmake make g++
```
JaPomoC depends on the "Simple and Fast Multimedia Library". If you are running a Debian-like system, you can install SFML with the following instructions. For other operating systems, have a look at http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/.

If SFML is in your repository, you can use that version.
```
# apt install libsfml-dev
```

Otherwise, SFML is checked out and buid with JaPomoC. Just install SFML dependencies.
```
# # Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 (will also require more recent version of cmake, though)
# apt install libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libudev-dev libfreetype6-dev libopenal-dev libvorbis-dev libflac-dev

# # Tested on Ubuntu 20.04
# apt install libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libudev-dev libfreetype-dev libopenal-dev libvorbis-dev libflac-dev # And? libopengl-dev libglx-dev
```

Build JaPomoC
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Kruecke/japomoc.git
$ cd japomoc

$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

Rules for `make install` are not implemented yet. Just run the game from the current build directory by executing `$ ./japomoc`.

### Installing on Windows
TODO: Needs to be updated.

These instructions base on Visual Studio 2013 Professional, but the free "Express" version should be absolutely sufficient for the build process. You can get a copy of it at http://www.visualstudio.com. Besides that, you need Git to download the recent copy of JaPomoC. You can get this free software at http://git-scm.com/download/win. Last but not least, get a copy of Cmake at http://www.cmake.org/. Install these three tools and move on to the next step.

#### Downloading JaPomoC
Start the installed Program "Git Bash" to open a command prompt and use `cd` to switch to a directory of your choice where you want to download JaPomoC to. Then run git to download the latest version of JaPomoC.
```
$ cd path/to/some/folder # this is optional
$ git clone https://github.com/Kruecke/japomoc.git
```

Don't close "Git Bash" just yet. You need it later on.

#### Getting SFML
JaPomoC depends on the "Simple and Fast Multimedia Library". You could check out JaPomoCs submodules to get the latest sources, but most times it is more convenient to just download a prebuild version from http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php. Make sure you download the files for your version of Visual Studio and grab a 32 bit version, otherwise you have to alter this instruction slightly later on. Once you've downloaded the archive, open your file explorer, extract the containing folder `SFML-2.x` and copy it's contents to `japomoc` -> `lib` -> `SFML`.

#### Building JaPomoC
To build the Visual Studio solution for JaPomoC, switch back to "Git Bash" and `cd` into the JaPomoC folder.
```
$ cd japomoc
```

Next, type in the following lines to create the Visual Studio solution files in a subfolder called `build` and to copy some SFML binaries to our `build` folder.
```
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -D SFML_ROOT=lib/SFML ..
$ cp ../lib/SFML/bin/* .
```

Finally, open your file explorer once again, browse to `japomoc` -> `build` and double-click `japomoc.sln` to load the solution into Visual Studio. In your `Solution Explorer` (probably on the right side of your screen), right-click the `japomoc` project and choose `Set as StartUp Project`. Now you can click the green "Play" arrow at the top (or push F5) to run the game. (This can take a moment the first time you run it.)

Unfortunately there is no installation routine yet. You have to run the game from Visual Studio (or from the `build` directory via command line). Sorry. :P
